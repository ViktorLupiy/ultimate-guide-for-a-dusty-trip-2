<p>the pay to win cars are the peak in this game worthy but you can travel km with them up to 300km/h mine p2w car is the future hover(in the photo) but what it rends them OP is the limited stock in general you go on the limited stock (the garage) and you look up for cool cars the max robux you can spend is 1699 or if you buy a bundle it will be up 4000</p>
