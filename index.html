<p>Yea the weapons are sooo many that you cant imagine the weapons can be rare if you find one just see what is write on the global or server chat if theres your name + the weapon you got it significatly says that you got a very rare item or weapon the most rarest are OP</p>

<p>these are like coins or something that you can trade in game or in the lobby These coins are useful if you get lost and you see a shop bottle caps useally founds at places alteast you can find a bottlecap on 1 place if you in a bossfight place you can find 90 to 50 groups of bottlecaps</p>
      <h1><br/>USELESS ITEMS</h1><img src="https://i.namu.wiki/i/JHC8okYJP9HcZ2uXBtae0-rlqJ2LKANCpjlN3n9TIYMpwGeimmshmgfcvRct8M00ybeipjAg9HZjnF2kZiAL9A.webp">
<p>useless items like a old chainsaw piece or a car piece are always founds at all locations you cant interact or use them they’re useless so dont grab them you wasting your time literally</p>
         <h1><br/>CAR PARTS</h1><img src="https://i.namu.wiki/i/g5NCIWXjaDlUljzxJwjjC4cN2QrN3AaPAaiNUQG04UDJrgWGnwAqopil3RVVJKPU6ZFQDrRGPas_yhq0r_Az0w.webp">
<p>you can find some car parts usually engines, doors, radiators, fuel and ecc.

            <h1>THE CARS</h1>
      <h1><br/>QUESTS CARS</h1><img src="https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/08/d0594-17232067164143-1920.jpg">
<p>The quests cars are free but you need to do some quests to have them free and the quests sometimes are RANDOM like attack 3 TV on your car and ecc.</p>
    <h1><br/>BASIC CARS</h1><img src="https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/headlights-dusty-trip.jpg">
<p>This is your first car ever build it fill it until this car is ready to go
Tip: Dont use this car in the photo use the Van this car goes 80 km/h but the Van goes 120km/h! so build the Van</p>
       <h1><br/>P2W CARS</h1><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bm_hHgJ4yQw/hq720.jpg?sqp=-oaymwE7CK4FEIIDSFryq4qpAy0IARUAAAAAGAElAADIQj0AgKJD8AEB-AH-CYAC0AWKAgwIABABGGUgWChBMA8=&rs=AOn4CLDzWF7RWi1wa_qZB075mcaQAhh3fQ">
<p>the pay to win cars are the peak in this game worthy but you can travel km with them up to 300km/h mine p2w car is the future hover(in the photo) but what it rends them OP is the limited stock in general you go on the limited stock (the garage) and you look up for cool cars the max robux you can spend is 1699 or if you buy a bundle it will be up 4000</p>
  <h1><br/>AIRPLANES</h1><img src="https://i0.wp.com/roonby.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot_259.jpg?fit=1024%2C541&ssl=1">
<p>airplanes are like the P2W cars they’re really extremely fast whey have weapons with unlimited ammo so it rend them extremely rare this airplane on the photo is the newest ac130 fast+3miniguns and colossal his rarity is mythic</p>
